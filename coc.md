## Code of Conduct
The Sydney Tech Leaders meetup (STL) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the STL organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any STL event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the STL organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the STL community. If you are being harassed please contact a STL organizer immediately. If you notice that someone else is being harassed please intercede of contact an STL organiser immediately. If you have any other concerns, please contact an STL organiser.

STL organizers developed this Code of Conduct to govern all STL events and communication channels. We used the [PDX Python code of conduct](https://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/pages/12061872/Code_of_Conduct/) as a guide, itself influenced by the [Geek Feminism Conference anti-harassment policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) as a starting point. This Code of Conduct, like its inspirations, is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license.
